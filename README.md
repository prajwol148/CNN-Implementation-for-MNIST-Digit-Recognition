## CNN Implementation for MNIST Digit Recognition
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark for image recognition tasks, consisting of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

#### a) Data Exploration and Preparation: 
Fetch the MNIST dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocess the data for training and testing.

#### b) CNN Architecture Design: 
Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for recognizing handwritten digit images.

#### c) Model Training: 
Train the CNN model on the MNIST training data.

#### d) Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the MNIST test data using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### e) K-Fold Cross-Validation: 
Perform K-Fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization capability.

#### f) Visualization and Analysis: 
Visualize the training process, feature maps, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the model's behavior.
