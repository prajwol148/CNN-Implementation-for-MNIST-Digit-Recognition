## CNN Implementation for MNIST Digit Recognition
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark for image recognition tasks, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

### Data Exploration and Preparation: 
Fetch the MNIST dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocess the data for training and testing.

### CNN Architecture Design: 
Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for recognizing handwritten digit images.

### Model Training: 
Train the CNN model on the MNIST training data.

### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the MNIST test data using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation: 
Perform K-Fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization capability.

### Visualization and Analysis: 
Visualize the training process, feature maps, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the model's behavior.
